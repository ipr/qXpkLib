xpkPP20 - "PP20" PowerPacker pack/unpack library

Based on PP-Tools by: David Tritscher, davidtritscher@dodo.com.au

Reworked to C++ library by: Ilkka Prusi, ilkka.prusi@gmail.com

Unlimited distribution.

Summary:
"PP20" implementation for qXpkLib to load.

Amiga PowerPacker decrunching support library.

This actually decrunches the original "stand-alone" format used by PowerPacker.

I believe there is also PowerPacker-supporting sub-library on Amiga for XPK
which uses XPK chunk-format on the file instead of PowerPacker's own,
but that isn't yet supported in this.. (Need sample to check.)

Uses code from my previous conversion, see: https://github.com/ipr/PowerPacker-decrunch
