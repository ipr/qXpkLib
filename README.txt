Summary:
Reusable XPK-decrunching library in Qt&C++, port from Amiga&Unix versions.


Description:
Library to support XPK decrunching (various algorithms).

XPK-library was originally created on Amiga for transparent decrunching support
of various packers and files (such as sound modules, images, text and executables).

Support on other platforms is rather limited, this is mostly port of Unix-version 
to access those files on other platforms.

Original XPK-libraries were made by Dirk Stöcker and others, see: http://www.dstoecker.eu/
The Unix-version made by Vesa Halttunen, see: http://www.jormas.com/~vesuri/xpk/


Licensing:
GPL v2, see COPYING.txt


In progress, details later..
This is more of rewrite as reusable library than actual porting, progress may be slow..
