xpkNUKE - "NUKE" unpacking library

Based on M68k-assembler code
by: Dirk Stöcker (SDI) <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

C-like rewrite by: Ilkka Prusi <ilkka.prusi@gmail.com>


Summary:
"NUKE" implementation for qXpkLib to load.

Note: "DUKE" uncompression (with delta) needs same code,
determine reuse (runtime library/compile-time class?).
Preferring generic sharing of libraries..

In progress..
