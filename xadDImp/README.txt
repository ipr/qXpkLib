xadDImp - Amiga "DImp" Disk-Imploder unpack library

Author: Ilkka Prusi, ilkka.prusi@gmail.com

Placeholder only for now, not done yet.

Summary:
Amiga "DImp" Disk-Imploder unpacking support library.

DImp uses same decrunching as "FImp" File-Imploder but for trackdisk (floppydisk) images.

TODO: should be possible to reuse "FImp" code in xfdImploder for unpacking,
either as runtime (load library) or compile-time (class reuse),
determine generic way for qXpkLib to share decrunchers with different libraries..?
